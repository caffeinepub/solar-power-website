  "summary": "REQ-1 appears not implemented because no shared frontend config module (frontend/src/config.ts) is added in the diff, and immutable hook files were modified despite constraints. REQ-2 appears implemented in AdminDashboard by wiring in loginError and providing UI elements for errors/retry (based on diff text and file summary), but the hook immutability acceptance criterion is violated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure a `frontend/src/config.ts` module exists and exports `loadConfig()` (returning at least `{ ii_derivation_origin: string }`) and `createActorWithConfig(...)`, with safe defaults so Internet Identity identityProvider is not undefined/invalid at runtime.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any added `frontend/src/config.ts` (or `frontend/src/config/index.ts`) file, only a new `project_state.json`. Without the config module being present, the stated import `../config` may still be unresolved or incomplete. Also, there is no evidence that `createActorWithConfig(...)` was implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json (only new file shown; no frontend/src/config.ts listed)",
        "frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts (imports `loadConfig` from '../config', but config module file is not shown as added)"

    {
      "description": "Modified immutable hook file(s), specifically `frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts`.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly forbids editing files under frontend immutablePaths (notably `frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts` and `frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts`). Any changes there are out of scope/violations rather than requested features.",
